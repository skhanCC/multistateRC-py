***Note that this project is under active development.***

## Features
- Fast optimization of filters for general multi-state time signals of arbitrary dimension and length
- Semi-analytically-determined optimal filters for special noise statistics (white noise)

## Roadmap

- [X] Function for analytic filters
- [X] Visualization tools: filter comparisons
- [X] Examples
- [ ] Visualization tools: confusion matrix
- [ ] Functionality for general training and testing data set sizes
