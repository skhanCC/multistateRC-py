# multistateRC-py
Multi-state classification of time-dependent signals using a trainable reservoir computing approach.
Implemented in Python.

Main features:
- Fast optimization of filters for general multi-state time signals of arbitrary dimension and length
- Semi-analytically-determined optimal filters for special noise statistics (white noise)
