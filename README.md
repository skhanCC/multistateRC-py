# multistateRC-py
Multi-state classification of time-dependent signals using a trainable reservoir computing approach. \
Implemented in Python.

***Note that this project is under active development.***

## Features
- Fast optimization of filters for general multi-state time signals of arbitrary dimension and length
- Semi-analytically-determined optimal filters for special noise statistics (white noise)

## Roadmap

- [.] Function for analytic filters
- [ ] Functionality for general training and testing data set sizes
- [ ] Visualization tools: confusion matrix?
- [ ] Examples
